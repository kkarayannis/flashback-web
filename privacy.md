# Privacy Policy

## We do not collect any type of data
We do not use any servers or 3rd party services for the functionality of the Photo Flashback app.

### Your photos are private
Photo Flashback will never upload your photos to any server and will not send them to anyone unless you chose to share them from within the app.

Photo Flashback fetches the photos it displays from your device, or from iCloud Photo Library indirectly via Apple's frameworks.

We use Apple's anonymous, opt-in crash reporting and analytics, which you can control from your device's settings.
